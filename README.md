# CURRENTLY BROKEN. ANY FIXERS ARE WELCOME. 
I gave up and printed the book 10 pages at a time. The sunk cost fallacy is real folks. took like 40 minutes to print it 10 pages at a time, and I was working on -this- for like 6 hours.
I'm washing my hands of this. If someone else wants to workm on this and make it automatic, I will gladly hand over ownership of this repo to you. 

Good Luck, And Fair Winds. I'll see you all on the high seas.
